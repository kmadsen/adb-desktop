## Ideas

These ideas came from ChatGPT so maybe build them.

1. **Push and pull files:** Ability to move files between the Android device and the computer. You can also include a drag-and-drop feature for user convenience.
2. **Backup and Restore:** This can include the full device backup, or selective backup like contacts, messages, apps, etc. Also, users might want to restore data from these backups.
3. **Screen Mirroring:** Allow users to mirror their Android device screen on their desktop.
4. **Screen Recording:** Let users record their screen or take screenshots, which could be useful for app developers to report bugs.
5. **Device Information Viewer:** Include a feature to view detailed information about the connected device like model, OS version, battery health, storage status, etc.
6. **App Management:** Install, uninstall, clear data, and move apps between storage locations. A batch operation feature would be useful here.
7. **Shell Command Executor:** Provide an interface to execute shell commands directly on the device.
8. **Networking Tools:** Include network management tools, like viewing active connections, data usage, and controlling network type (WiFi, mobile data, etc.)
9. **Process Viewer:** Similar to the task manager on Windows, show the running processes and services, with the ability to kill any if necessary.
10. **Emulator Customization:** Features to customize the emulator, like screen size, memory size, device model, etc.
11. **Multi-device support:** Allow users to connect and manage multiple devices at once.
12. **Power Management:** Power control options like reboot, shutdown, and screen on/off could be very useful.
13. **Notification Management:** Display phone notifications in real-time on the desktop and allow users to interact with them.
14. **SMS and Call Management:** Read and send SMS messages, answer or reject incoming calls.
15. **Inbuilt Tutorial or Guide:** As ADB commands can be complex, having an inbuilt guide could be helpful for less experienced users.
16. **Themes and Customizations:** Ability for users to customize the look and feel of the application.
17. **Auto Update System:** Keep your application updated with latest ADB and Fastboot versions.
18. **Fastboot Mode:** Add support for devices in fastboot mode like unlocking, flashing, and booting.
